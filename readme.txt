A button to allow for a quick exit on websites dealing with sensitive content such as Domestic Violence.

== Description ==
This plugin will insert a safety exit button onto your site. A safety exit button is ideal for websites dealing with sensitive subjects such as domestic violence, rape, child abuse and others. When the user clicks the button they will instantly redirected to a URL of your choosing and a new tab / window will be opened to a URL of your choosing.

The button is customizable with options to change the color of the button and font, pick an icon from fontawesome's free icon library, update font size, change what the button says and more features coming in the future.


== Installation ==
1. Search for 'Safety Exit' in the plugin directory
2. Click install then Activate.
OR to install manually
1. Download the plugin
2. Upload `safety-exit.zip` to the `wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Once installed and activated you will see a new menu item for "Safety Exit". That is where you can customize the button.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there an option to delete the browser history? =
No. Due to security measures taken by browsers, websites can not delete browser history. If this ever changes or if browsers support a new function that will let websites control history you can expect it to be added to the plugin ASAP.

= Can I request features? =
Yes! I love feature ideas and requests to make this thing better. You can submit a feature request under the support tab.

= Can I customize the button more than the options you gave me? =
You can! If you know some CSS you can insert custom CSS and target \"#sftExt-frontend-button\". In the future there are plans to add support for custom HTML and CSS as well as more options to tweak the button more.

= Why cant I put the button in the menu or at the top of the page? =
Currently there are only two options for button placement. \"Bottom Left\" and \"Bottom Right\". There are plans to add support for other button placement options such as in the menu, as a widget, a banner at the top of the page, and more.

== Changelog ==
1.7.1:

	- Refactor: Completely reworked how the button is rendered. It will try to render via HTML first. If it cant it will render with JS. This should finally fix all theme related problems.
	- Improved: Got some unit testing in place. When the plugin's admin UI gets refactored this will help ensuring nothing breaks on the front end.
	- Removed: I removed the contrast checker. It was large, annoying and didn't work very well. I will be replacing it with something better in V2.
	- Fix: Button will no longer appear on the print view.
